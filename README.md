## **Merging Models**

To merge models, specifically for the **T-shirt merging task**, follow these steps:

### **How to Merge Models**

1. **Prepare Your Models**:
    - Ensure you have the models you want to merge. For **T-shirt merging**, you should have the base T-shirt model and any additional models to combine.

2. **Use ComfyUI's Model Merging Feature**:
    - Launch **ComfyUI**.
    - Open the nodes interface by navigating to the relevant section in ComfyUI.
    - Use the model merging node available in ComfyUI, and add this node to your workflow.

3. **Configure the Model Merging Node**:
    - Add your **base T-shirt model** as one of the inputs.
    - Add the other models you want to merge as additional inputs.
    - Configure any settings specific to your merging process, including weights or adjustment parameters.

4. **Execute the Workflow**:
    - Once your nodes are properly configured, queue up the workflow for execution.
    - ComfyUI will process the merging of the models according to the setup you've defined.

5. **Save and Load the Merged Model**:
    - After merging, you can **save** the new model.
    - This merged model can be loaded into ComfyUI for further use or adjustments.
