Merging Models
To merge models, specifically for the T-shirt merging task, follow these steps:

How to Merge Models
Prepare Your Models:

Ensure you have the models you want to merge. For T-shirt merging, you should have the base T-shirt model and any additional models you want to combine with it.
Use ComfyUI's Model Merging Feature:

Launch ComfyUI.
Open the nodes interface by navigating to the relevant section in ComfyUI.
Use the model merging node available in ComfyUI. You can add this node to your workflow.
Configure the Model Merging Node:

Add your base T-shirt model as one of the inputs.
Add the other models you want to merge as additional inputs.
Configure any settings specific to your merging process. This may include specifying weights or adjustment parameters.
Execute the Workflow:

Once your nodes are properly configured, queue up the workflow for execution.
ComfyUI will process the merging of the models according to the setup youâ€™ve defined.
Save and Load the Merged Model:
